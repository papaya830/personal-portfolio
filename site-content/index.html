            Hi there! My name is Chloe, and I am a third year Software Systems major at SFU doing a minor in
            Computer and Electronics design. I'm interested in software development, technical management,
            and computer engineering. I am currently doing a co-op at Improving (formerly BitQuill Technologies),
            as a Software Developer (check out projects to see what things I've been working on!). In my spare time
            I love to stay active, going on food adventures, and building things.
            I'm currently training for a triathlon which I will be competing for in March.
            I have been playing competitive volleyball for my entire youth, and I still play in leagues.
